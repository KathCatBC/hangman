	Theme Formula 1 drivers (current or past champions TBD)

	Get image for win (checkered flag perhaps)
	Get image for lose (crashed car perhaps)
	Get a background image(s)

	Create an Array with names (would a 2D array be better?)
	Create an empty array for wrong letter guesses
	Generate a random number to pick a name from the Array


Screen Display

	put a _ everywhere there should be a letter - remember to deal with spaces


	Create a display for wrong letters guessed


	How many wrong choices should the user be allowed before crashing?

	Make sure a user is not penalized for using the wrong cane
	Will e == E? If not always compare using the same case


	Generate a random number to pick a name from the array
	Display the _ in the proper layout

	Get a letter input from the user

	If it is in the name display it in the correct positions (replace the _ with the letter)
		Else put the wrong letter in the "wrong letter display and array"
		

		If wrong letter array length >= max guesses (it should never be > but just in case use > )
			Then Show Fail Display
			Prompt to play again

		If user correctly guesses all the letters 
			Then show win display
			Prompt to play again
